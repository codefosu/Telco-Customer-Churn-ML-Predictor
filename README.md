# Predicting Customer Churn: A Machine Learning Approach
## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, especially in the telecommunications industry. Understanding and predicting when a customer might leave can significantly impact a company's strategies and operations. In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn based on specific inputs. The project was titled "Telco Customer Churn Machine Learning Predictor."
Project Overview
The project involved several key steps:
Data Collection
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Hypothesis Testing
Data Preparation
Modeling
Evaluation

1. Data Collection
Our data came from multiple sources:
SQL Server: The primary data source.
OneDrive and GitHub: Additional data repositories.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is crucial to understand the data's underlying patterns and relationships. We performed:
Univariate Analysis: Examining individual features.
Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between pairs of features.
Multivariate Analysis: Investigating interactions between multiple features.

3. Hypothesis Testing
We formulated a hypothesis to determine if there is a significant relationship between tenure and customer churn. This step helped in understanding if tenure could be a strong predictor of churn.
4. Data Preparation
Preparing the data involved several steps:
Data Splitting: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.

Pipeline Creation: Building preprocessing and modeling pipelines.

5. Modeling
We tested four different models to identify the best one for predicting customer churn:
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

For each model, we:
Plotted ROC curves.
Calculated performance metrics such as F1 score, precision, and recall.
Analyzed the correlation matrix.

6. Evaluation and Results
After evaluating the models, we selected the best one based on the performance metrics. The chosen model demonstrated a high level of accuracy and reliability in predicting customer churn.
Conclusion
The Telco Customer Chain Machine Learning Predictor successfully identified potential churners, enabling proactive customer retention strategies. The combination of data from various sources, thorough EDA, and rigorous model testing ensured a robust and reliable solution.

Further Analysis with Power BI
We also created a Power BI dashboard for interactive and visual analysis of the data and model results. This dashboard allows for dynamic exploration and insights into customer churn patterns.
